export const body1 = `Hello, world!

Currently, there is no backend for this application. I'll use this article as an opportunity to describe it. First, I'll discuss what qualities the ideal framework should have. Next, I'll talk about the general schema.`;

export const body2 = `Hello, world!

Watch this paragraph dissapear in Version 3. :)

Currently, there is no backend for this application. I'll use this article as an opportunity to describe it. First, I'll talk about the general schema and backend setup. Then, I'll talk about a few extra considerations.`;

export const body3 = `Hello, world!

Currently, there is no backend for this application. I'll use this article as an opportunity to describe it. First, I'll talk about the general schema and backend setup. Then, I'll talk about a few extra considerations.

The schema should at least have authors and articles tables. The authors model would be responsible for handling authentication and preventing unauthorized access to certain routes. The articles model will have more logic concerning the format of each article, but there will be extra authentication to increase security.`;

export const body4 = `Hello, Authorea!

Currently, there is no backend for this application. I'll use this article as an opportunity to describe it. First, I'll talk about the general schema and backend setup. Then, I'll talk about a few extra considerations.

The schema should at least have authors and articles tables. The authors model would be responsible for handling authentication and preventing unauthorized access to certain routes. The articles model will have more logic concerning the format of each article, but there will be extra authentication to increase security.

A major consideration for backend design should be the framework selection. There should be adequate support for images and BLOBs (Binary Large Objects), as figures are an essential element of research papers.

Until then, have a good day!
